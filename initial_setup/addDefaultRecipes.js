    ingredients: ['1 15-ounce block firm tofu (drained, patted dry, and cubed)', '1 Â½ tsp curry powder (or store-bought)', '1 Tbsp coconut aminos', '1/4 tsp sea salt',
      '2 tsp nutritional yeast (adds a slightly cheesy flavor)', '5 cups loosely packed fresh spinach (organic when possible // 5 cups equals ~6 ounces)'],
    instructions: ['This recipe is all about multi-tasking and is totally doable in 30 minutes. Start by preheating the oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and draining your tofu. Then wrap in a clean towel and set something heavy on top. (This step can also be done in advance with a tofu press.)',
